📚 Library Management System (Mini Project 1)

This is a simple Library Management System built in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. It allows users to add books, add members, issue books, return books with fines, and view the inventory. The system also logs every important action into a log file.

🚀 Features::

✔️ Add Books

Store book details like:

Book ID

Title

Author

Availability status

✔️ Add Members:

Register members with:

Member ID

Name

Borrowed book records

✔️ Issue Books:

Checks if the book exists

Checks if the book is already issued

Checks if the member is valid

Logs every issued book in a library_log.txt file

✔️ Return Books:

Validates if the member actually borrowed the book

Marks book as returned

Calculates fine (₹2 per late day)

Logs the return with fine amount

✔️ Show Inventory:

Displays all books with:

ID

Title

Author

Status (Available / Issued)

✔️ Log File Support:

Every operation is automatically logged with a timestamp:

✔️ Custom Exceptions:

Handled using two user-defined exceptions:

BookNotAvailableException

InvalidReturnException
